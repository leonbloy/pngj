How This API Document Is Organized</H1>
</CENTER>
This API (Application Programming Interface) document has pages corresponding to the items in the navigation bar, described as follows.<H3>
Overview</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The <A HREF="overview-summary.html">Overview</A> page is the front page of this API document and provides a list of all packages with a summary for each.  This page can also contain an overall description of the set of packages.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Package</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each package has a page that contains a list of its classes and interfaces, with a summary for each. This page can contain four categories:<UL>
<LI>Interfaces (italic)<LI>Classes<LI>Enums<LI>Exceptions<LI>Errors<LI>Annotation Types</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Class/Interface</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each class, interface, nested class and nested interface has its own separate page. Each of these pages has three sections consisting of a class/interface description, summary tables, and detailed member descriptions:<UL>
<LI>Class inheritance diagram<LI>Direct Subclasses<LI>All Known Subinterfaces<LI>All Known Implementing Classes<LI>Class/interface declaration<LI>Class/interface description
<P>
<LI>Nested Class Summary<LI>Field Summary<LI>Constructor Summary<LI>Method Summary
<P>
<LI>Field Detail<LI>Constructor Detail<LI>Method Detail</UL>
Each summary entry contains the first sentence from the detailed description for that item. The summary entries are alphabetical, while the detailed descriptions are in the order they appear in the source code. This preserves the logical groupings established by the programmer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Annotation Type</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each annotation type has its own separate page with the following sections:<UL>
<LI>Annotation Type declaration<LI>Annotation Type description<LI>Required Element Summary<LI>Optional Element Summary<LI>Element Detail</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Enum</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Each enum has its own separate page with the following sections:<UL>
<LI>Enum declaration<LI>Enum description<LI>Enum Constant Summary<LI>Enum Constant Detail</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>
Prev/Next</H3>
These links take you to the next or previous class, interface, package, or related page.<H3>
Frames/No Frames</H3>
These links show and hide the HTML frames.  All pages are available with or without frames.
<P>
<H3>
Serialized Form</H3>
Each serializable or externalizable class has a description of its serialization fields and methods. This information is of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the API. While there is no link in the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Serialized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.
<P>
<H3>
Constant Field Values</H3>
The <a href="constant-values.html">Constant Field Values</a> page lists the static final fields and their values.
