<b>PNGJ: a pure Java library for PNG image encoding/decoding</b>
<p>
Main features:
<ul>
<li>Very efficient in memory usage and speed.
<li>Pure Java (requires 5 or greater). 
<li>Small and self contained. No dependencies on third party libraries, nor even on <code>java.awt.*/javax.imageio.*</code>
<li>Runs on GAE (Google App Engine) and Android
<li>Allows to read/write progressively, row by row. This means that
you can process huge images without needing to load them fully in memory.
<li>Reads all PNG color models (true color, gray, palette, all bit depths: 1-2-4-8-16,
with-without alpha). Interlaced PNG is supported (though not welcomed).
<li>Writes all PNG color models - interlaced PNG writing is <i>not</i> supported.
<li>Full support for metadata (CHUNKS) handling.
<li>Supports (since 2.0) asyncronous reading.
<li>The format of the pixel data (read and write) is extensible (since 2.0) 
and very  efficient (no double copies).
<li>Supports (since 2.0) low level tweaking and extension in the reader.
<li>Open source (Apache 2.0 licence)
</ul>
<p>
Note that this is a relatively low-level library. 
It does not provide any high-level image processing (eg, resizing,
colour conversions), nor tries to abstract the concrete image format
(as BufferedImage does, for example). In particular, the default format 
of the scanlines (as wrapped in ImageLineInt or ImageLineByte) is not
abstract, the meaning of the values depends on the image color model and bitdepth.
